This is a simple program to switch PulseAudio output between your device and
laptop. The code is very raw and ugly, but is out there to demonstrate how
simple doing such this is, with PulseAudio. There are a lot of TODOs (marked
with XXXs in comments), and terrible coding practices (don't look at the use of
the configuration system!).

To build, you will need to fix up RELATIVE_AOSP_PATH in jni/Android.mk. This
eventually needs to be fixed up to take the path to the AOSP[1] build (with
PulseAudio support[2]) via an environment variable.
